### BASIC INSTALLATION

Install [NUMPY AND SCIPY](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). 
Install [PYFITS](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits/Download).

The following assumes you have numpy, scipy and pyfits installed.

Simply download all the files/zip from GitHub.

Place all files in a single directroy, e.g. ~/PyMORESANE

Add the following to your .bashrc or .bash_aliases:  
alias runsane='python ~/PyMORESANE/pymoresane.py'

If you have put the PyMORESANE folder elsewhere, simply amend the alias to reflect its location.

Running pymoresane.py is as simple as typing runsane followed by the inputs you desire. runsane --help should provide some assitance, otherwise the docstrings/comments in the code are very detailed.
